### **Wine Quality Prediction: Regression Analysis**  
ðŸ“Š **Predicting Wine Quality Using Regression Models**  

## **Overview**  
This project analyzes the factors influencing wine quality using regression techniques, such as **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)** and **ElasticNet**. We explore how different chemical properties impact wine quality scores and assess the effectiveness of interaction terms in improving model performance.  

## **Dataset**  
The dataset contains physicochemical properties (e.g., acidity, alcohol content, sulfur dioxide levels) of wine samples, along with expert-rated quality scores ranging from 3 to 8. Given the imbalance in the quality distribution, two models were performate: one, without altering the data, and the other merging quality scores 3 and 4, and 8 and 7.  

## **Objective**  
- Identify key factors influencing wine quality  
- Compare **OLS and ElasticNet** regression models  
- Evaluate the impact of **interaction terms**  
- Evaluate the impact of **merging the quality score**  

## **Key Findings**  
- **Alcohol and Sulphates** are the strongest predictors of wine quality.  
- Adding the **alcohol Ã— sulphates interaction term** improves predictive power.  
- **ElasticNet regression provides a balance** between Ridge and Lasso but does not always outperform simpler models.  
- **Merging quality labels** does not significantly alter model performance but slightly reduces MSE.
